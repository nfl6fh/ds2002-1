Thanksgiving Lab/Class

In light of recent events and with folks headed home early, we will add a module that I didn’t do this semester but usually do. Here we will investigate Regular Expressions (RegEx). RegEx is a powerful tool for anyone who needs to analyze, sort, fix large amounts of text. Think of it as a fancy way to do “Search and Replace” like you would in Microsoft Word.

Objective:
1.	Learn the fundamentals of Regular Expressions
2.	Apply them in a Python Program

What do you need to read/listen to?
1.	Read through the slides posted on GitHub
2.	Read additional article if you need it
3.	Complete the Google Lab Part A. Be sure to read the section above to get the require files and and setup you may need to do.

When is it due?  This LAB will be due on Wednesday 30th, via Collab. However, as usual, just post your work in Github and put the link in the assignment.
